 Fake-News-Detection-with-Explainability-
Multi-model fake news detection system using NLP and machine learning with LIME explainability to interpret model decisions.
# ðŸ“° Multi-Model Fake News Detection with Explainability

This project is an explainable machine learning app that detects whether a news article is **FAKE** or **REAL**, using multiple classification models and the LIME framework to explain predictions.

Features

-  Trains 3 models: Logistic Regression, Passive Aggressive, and Linear SVM
-  TF-IDF vectorization for text features
- F1-score comparison across models
- Predicts real/fake label on any news input
- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain **why** a model made its decision
-  Built with Streamlit for interactivity
